             <p>Morals teach a lesson about right and wrong. While fables are rich with morals, other kinds of fiction don't necessarily rely on them.</p>

<p>A hungry fox once looked everywhere for food. He couldn t find anything until he stumbled upon a farmer s wall. He saw big, purple, juicy grapes. He jumped as high as possible to reach the grapes. No matter how many times he tried, he failed. Finally, he gave up and went home, thinking to himself that the grapes must have been sour anyway.

<p>A farmer had a goose that laid one golden egg a day. He would sell the golden eggs, and they enjoyed a comfortable life. However, the farmer became greedy and wanted more than one egg a day. His wife foolishly agreed to his idea. The next day the farmer cut open the goose after it laid the golden egg. He could only find blood and guts. He realised his mistake. He now had no source of income, and the couple became poorer every day.
